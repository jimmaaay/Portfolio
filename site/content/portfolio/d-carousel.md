d-carousel is a carousel library based off of **g-carousel** that is shown in google search results.

This library doesn't have any dependencies and is sitting at just under 4kb (before gzip compression). The javascript is only required to make the previous & next buttons functional. Meaning the carousel can be used (on devices that let you scroll sideways without a scrollbar) before the javascript is loaded.
