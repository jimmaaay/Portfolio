This project was an experiment using WebRTC. The app allows for you to talk to another person over WebRTC this means that no chat messages ever touch a server. A STUN server is initially used to get the connection details which you then send to the other person (probably using another chat app).

I plan on improving this app by adding file sharing capabilities & multi person chat support.
