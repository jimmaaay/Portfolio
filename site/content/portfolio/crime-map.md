A google map where you can get crime statistics in your area. 

## How It Works

The map allows you to search for your town / city and then see the crime statistics there. This doesn't work so well with larger cities **e.g Birmingham / London** ( something I plan on fixing ).

## API's Used:

* UK Police API - Getting crime data based on lat,lng coordinates [https://data.police.uk](https://data.police.uk)
* Google Maps API - Used for displaying the map, markers & also gets the lat,lng coordinates of bounds of the location you searched for.
